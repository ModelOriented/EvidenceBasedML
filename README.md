# Evidence-Based Machine Learning

<center><img width=800 src="temida.png"></center>

Surprisingly often, data analysis and model development is based on intuitions, gut feelings, judgements or random try-check-repeat exploration. The practice of model development is often based on local fashions, which method just got better results on Kaggle. It's full of myths. It is full of myths and brute-force solutions that generate a hidden debt.

To overcome this chaos we need to develop safe standards for developing, comparing and monitoring models.

The goal of the Evidence-based Machine Learning is to develop practices based on the results of well-designed scientific studies indicating which methods work best. The evidence-based education movement has its roots in the larger movement towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_practice">Evidence-based practices</a>.
